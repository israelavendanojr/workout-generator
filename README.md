myLiftPlan
At the start of the year, I noticed many of my friends wanted to start going to the gym as part of their New Yearâ€™s resolutions, but without a clear plan, it was hard for them to get started and stay consistent. So, this spring break, I decided to build something to help solve this: myLiftPlan â€” a full-stack web application that generates personalized weekly workout routines based on user preferences.

Key Features:
Users can create a workout plan without an account.

Logging in allows users to save, update, and delete their workout plans, making it easier to stay on track with their fitness goals.

Tech Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

Backend: Python/Flask for workout plan generation and user session management

Database: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy to manage user data and workout plans

I hope it becomes a solid starting point for many on their fitness journeys!
